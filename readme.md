Some Sample Code for CurveID's Lighting Project

This repository holds sample code for CurveID's lighting side project.  The system architecture consists of an Arduino which reads the input of a rotary encoder and modulates the light output of a neopixel strip.

To get started download Arduino;https://www.arduino.cc/
Then install the Adafruit Neopixel Library https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-installation

Then make the connections accordingly of the following hardware

LED Neopixel Strip  https://www.adafruit.com/product/1506
Rotary Encoder https://www.adafruit.com/products/377
Power Supply to LED's https://www.adafruit.com/product/658
Arduino Uno is the current one in use -
Could Switch to An Arduino Pro Mini 5v. - https://www.adafruit.com/products/2378
but you'll need this cable https://www.adafruit.com/products/70 to program it. You could then power it though the cable and an iphone usb charger or purchase a lithium ion or 9V battery. http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/97184/how-to-power-arduino-pro-mini-via-vcc-pin-12v-input
