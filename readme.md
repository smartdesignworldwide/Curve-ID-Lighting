Some Sample Code for CurveID's Lighting Project

This repository holds sample code for CurveID's lighting side project.  The system architecture consists of an Arduino which reads the input of a rotary encoder and modulates the light output of a neopixel strip.

To get started download Arduino;https://www.arduino.cc/
Then install the Adafruit Neopixel Library https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-installation
